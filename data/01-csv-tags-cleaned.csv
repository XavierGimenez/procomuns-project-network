The FairCoin,"All current cryptocurrencies require you to buy the coins, either through mining or through exchanges. This gives the advantage to those who already have capital and mining equipment, and can afford risky investments. FairCoin is the first project where the coins are not bought but rather distributed equally between everyone who wants them regardless of their current financial status, and promotes equality.

FairCoin is a crypto currency like Bitcoin. It is a descendant of Peercoin, meaning the block generation is done by PoW/PoS hybrid.

FairCoin is a decentralised virtual currency, distributed through a vast airdrop process during the 6th and 8th of March, 2014 (view airdrop statistics). An approximate 49,750 addresses were logged for the giveaway, each able to claim 1000 FAIR per hour. Automated airdrop claiming methods had no effect, as each IP address could register once per hour, and 2 different captchas had to be solved. These security precautions were hidden till the day of distribution. FairCoin's vast distribution method allowed a good portion of the cryptocurrency community to claim a little bit of the 50,000,000 FairCoins, each.",http://fair-coin.org,https://twitter.com/FairCoinTeam,,http://fair-coin.org/#contact,Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network,,other,2014-01-01 00:00:00,English,,"p2p,cryptocurrency",P2P economy,Collage,Resource,Other,,International,David Rozas,529
The Common House,"The Common House is an experiment in building a commons – by which we mean a resource that is organised and structured by our collective activity as a community and not by money or property rights. We always want new groups and people to get involved in running the space. It is only people, together, that can create commons.

In 2013 we got together and collectively rented The Common House because we had a common problem. Most spaces in London cost too much, were not open the hours we needed and we wanted to have food and kids at our meetings. We also wanted a space to have parties in, eat together, watch films, make banners, props and we needed a home for our printing press.

By imagining The Common House as a commons we are able think about how to manage and reproduce the resources that we need. We can imagine these resources not as objects, commodities or things we own – but instead as processes of our activity and labour. The Common House is not just a space to be used or consumed, but is a collective attempt to organise and maintain infrastructure and resources for radical ideas and practices. A commons is different to private space (individually owned) and public space (state maintained). It is maintained by the people who use it. It has members, not consumers.

Commons are not open in the sense that anyone or anything goes. Instead, it allows us to think about how to reproduce what we need within the constraints that we face and to manage resources outside of the regimes of both the state and capital. The commons are a pre-condition for, and an experiment in, building struggles capable of winning and bringing about the world that we want: one that is collectively owned and decided.

Apache  HTTP Server ,"The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.
Apache httpd has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996.
The Apache HTTP Server (""httpd"") is a project of The Apache Software Foundation.
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is an American non-profit corporation created to support Apache software projects, including the Apache HTTP Server. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated in Delaware, U.S., in June 1999.
The Apache Software Foundation is composed by a decentralized community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is therefore free and open source software (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation open-source organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in.

Among the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects; to prevent the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.
The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects, related technology, and encouraging Apache developers to gather together.",http://httpd.apache.org/,,apache@apache.org,http://www.apache.org/foundation/contact.html,Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network,United States,not for profit organization,1999-01-01 00:00:00,English,,,FLOSS communities,Collage,Resource,Copyright,Release under the Apache License: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0,International,mberlinguer,499

Steam workshop,"The Steam Workshop is a central hub of player-created content and tools to publish, organize, and download that content into the video games of the Steam platform (see below). 

Different games will utilize the Workshop in different ways. Some games, like Team Fortress 2, allow you to create and submit new items (such as hats, weapons, badges, boots, and more) for consideration to be incorporated into the actual game.  Other games like Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim allow mod authors to publish their work directly to the Workshop, and let players subscribe to mods they want to use in their game.

The acceptable items, entry rules, and rewards may be different for each product. Not all of the products are free.

Steam is a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer, and communications platform developed by Valve Corporation. It is used to distribute games and related media online, from small independent developers to larger software houses.

OhmyNews,"OhmyNews is a South Korean online news website that has the motto ""Every Citizen is a Reporter"". It was founded by Oh Yeon Ho on 2000. It is the first of its kind in Korea to accept, edit and publish articles from its readers, in an open source style of news reporting.[2] About 20% of the site's content is written by the 55-person staff, while most of the articles are written by other freelance contributors who are mostly ordinary citizens.",http://www.ohmynews.com/,"https://twitter.com/ohmynews_korea, https://www.facebook.com/OhmyNewsKorea, http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/Help/srv/h_help_rss.aspx",ohmynews@ohmynews.com,http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/Company/contact.aspx?det=partner,Business,,for profit organization,2000-01-01 00:00:00,Korean,,,Collaborative filtering,Album,"Resource, Service",Copyright,"History
OhmyNews was influential in determining the outcome of the South Korean presidential election, 2002.[3] After being elected, President Roh Moo-hyun granted his first interview to OhmyNews.
OhmyNews International is an English language online newspaper that features ""citizen reporter"" articles written by contributors from all over the globe. Its content is almost 100% citizen reporter.
On February 22, 2006, OhmyNews and Japanese firm Softbank signed an investment contract valued at US$11 million. In 2006 OhmyNews started to build a Japan-based citizen-participatory journalism site called OhmyNews Japan, launched on August 28 with a famous Japanese journalist and 22 other employees working under ten reporters. These journalists' articles were the object of much criticism;[citation needed] on November 17, 2006, the newspaper ended the citizen-participation aspect of the paper. The South Korean newspaper admitted that OhmyNews Japan had failed.[4] In July 2008, all staff of OhmyNews Japan were dismissed, and by the end of August operations had ceased on the site.
The 2nd Citizen Reporters' Forum was held by OhmyNews in Seoul, Korea from July 12–15, 2006.[5] The 3rd International Citizen Reporters Forum was held by OhmyNews in Seoul from June 27–29, 2007.
On November 24, 2007, OhmyNews opened a ""citizen journalism school"" to serve as a ""collaborative knowledge center"" for classes in journalism, digital cameras and photojournalism. It is located 90 minutes from Seoul in the refurbished building of an elementary school. The faculty will include OhmyNews editors and other journalists from print, radio and television. There is in-school lodging and dining capacity for 50 guests.
On July 8, 2009, Oh Yeon-ho revealed that Ohmynews was losing up to 700 m won yearly, and appealed to website users to join a voluntary subscription scheme.[6]
Critics[who?] argue that Ohmynews is losing original features as alternative–independent media in financial independence. Oh Yeon-ho said, “70 to 80 percent of our revenue came from corporate advertising and sponsorships. In contrast, contributions from readers only totaled five percent of total revenue.” Oh also said, “We have not received a cent from Lee Myungbak government for central government advertising.”[6]
However a government report to National Assembly in 2009 revealed that Ohmynews received 120 m won (approximately 100,000 dollars) for government advertising from February 2008 to July 2009.[7]
An Ohmynews report said they had received about 870 m won (approximately 900,000 dollars) for government advertising from 2003 to 2007 by introducing government official reports to National Assembly.[8]
An alternative medium Pressian reported Oh's comments, ""I respect Samsung as major business partner,"" and introduced about 20 percent of the total advertising and cooperation revenue of Ohmynews is coming from Samsung for years, the biggest business corporate of Korea.[9]
On August 1, 2010, OhMyNews of South Korea announced a change in its format from an ""edited citizen journalist news site"" to a ""blog dedicated to covering and discussing the world of citizen journalism itself,"" starting the following month.
Simply, OmN had become a victim of its own success; their paid editorial staff no longer felt that they could verify facts in stories that poured in from all over the world—roughly 225 articles/day from a pool of 70,000 citizen journalists.
""Curators are important to our operation. They are given a great deal of trust. In order to maintain credibility amongst our team members, new curators join through recommendations of existing curators. And even amongst the curators we have different levels depending on their experience and contributions. This is to maintain a steady level of quality and credibility with our readers.""[10]",National,mberlinguer,485
Indymedia or Independent Media Center ,"The Independent Media Center, also known as Indymedia, was the first open publishing platform in the world. Indymedia uses an open publishing and democratic media process that allows anybody to contribute. It originated during the Seattle anti-WTO protests worldwide in 1999 and remains closely associated with the global justice movement, which criticizes neo-liberalism and its associated institutions. 
The Independent Media Center (also known as Indymedia or IMC) is a global participatory network of journalists that report on political and social issues.
According to its homepage, ""Indymedia is a collective of independent media organizations and hundreds of journalists offering grassroots, non-corporate coverage. Indymedia is a democratic media outlet for the creation of radical, accurate, and passionate tellings of truth."" Indymedia was founded as an alternative to government and corporate media, and seeks to facilitate people being able to publish their media as directly as possible.",http://www.indymedia.org/or/index.shtml,http://www.indymedia.org/or/main-features.rss,www-features@lists.indymedia.org,,Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network,,not for profit organization,1999-01-01 00:00:00,"Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese",,,"Collaborative video, audio, images",Album,"Resource, Service",Creative Commons: Attribution-NonCommercial (CC-BY-NC),In June 2012 self-registration on the Indymedia Documentation Project (docs.indymedia.org) was closed to allow the maintainers to take some actions.

The Guardian Project ,"The Guardian Project is a global collective of software developers, designers, advocates, activists and trainers who develop open source mobile security software and operating system enhancements. They also create customized mobile devices to help individuals communicate more freely and protect themselves from intrusion and monitoring. The effort specifically focuses on users who live or work in high-risk situations, and who often face constant surveillance and intrusion attempts into their mobile devices and communication streams.
The Guardian Project creates easy-to-use open source apps, mobile OS security enhancements, and customized mobile devices for people around the world to help them communicate more freely, and protect themselves from intrusion and monitoring.
The Guardian Project was founded by Nathan Freitas in 2009 in Brooklyn, NY. Since it was founded, the Guardian Project has developed more than a dozen mobile apps for Android and iOS with over two million downloads and hundreds of thousands of active users. In the last five years the Guardian Project has partnered with prominent open source software projects, activists groups, NGOs, commercial partners and news organizations to support their mobile security software capabilities. Their work has been made possible with funding from Google, UC Berkeley with the MacArthur Foundation, Avaaz, Internews, Open Technology Fund, WITNESS, the Knight Foundation, Benetech, and Free Press Unlimited. Through work on partner projects like The Tor Project, Commotion mesh and StoryMaker, they have received indirect funding from both the US State Department through the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Internet Freedom program, and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs through HIVOS.

One application, still currently in its Beta testing phase, is InformaCam: it allows users to attach metadata like GPS coordinates, timestamps, compass bearing, altitude, and light meter readings, among other attributes, to digital pictures and video. These features are designed to provide journalists, human rights activists, and the legal community with the tools to secure and verify images and footage from areas of conflict and political unrest, where access to consistent, reliable information can be scarce. 
The application also has the ability to encrypt a user’s data, permits them to share media only with specified users, and connects to social media platforms like Facebook and Flickr for easy, secure posting. InformaCam also supports delivery of media to a server through the Tor network, hosted as a Tor Hidden Service. InformaCam uses the built in sensors in modern smartphones as well wi-fi, bluetooth, and cell tower information to create a snapshot of the environment in which an image or video was captured. This validates the date, time and location of capture. Digital signatures and encryption ensure that your media hasn't been tampered with and can only be opened by the intended recipient.

Amul,"Amul is an Indian dairy cooperative, based at Anand in the state of Gujarat, India.[2] The word amul (अमूल) is derived from the Sanskrit word amulya (अमूल्य), meaning invaluable.[3] The co-operative was initially referred to as Anand Milk Federation Union Limited hence the name AMUL.

Formed in 1946, it is a brand managed by a cooperative body, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF), which today is jointly owned by 3 million milk producers in Gujarat.[4]

Amul spurred India's White Revolution, which made the country the world's largest producer of milk and milk products.[5] In the process Amul became the largest food brand in India and has ventured into markets overseas.

Dr Verghese Kurien, founder-chairman of the GCMMF for more than 30 years (1973–2006), is credited with the success of Amul.[6]

Zipcar,"Zipcar is a US membership-based carsharing company providing automobile reservations to its members, billable by the hour or day. Zipcar was founded in 2000 by Cambridge, Massachusetts residents Antje Danielson and Robin Chase.

On 14 March 2013 Avis Budget Group purchased Zipcar for about US$500 million in cash. Zipcar will operate as a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group. Scott Griffith, who had run the company for the previous 10 years, resigned the day after the acquisition closed, and passed the reins to a new company President, Mark Norman.

As of July 2013, the company had more than 810,000 members and offers nearly 10,000 vehicles throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain and Austria, making Zipcar the world's leading car sharing network.

Members can reserve Zipcars online or by phone at any time, immediately or up to a year in advance. Zipcar members have automated access to Zipcars using an access card which works with the car's technology to unlock the door, where the keys are already located inside. Zipcar also offers an iPhone or Android application that allows members to honk the horn to locate a Zipcar and unlock the doors. Zipcar charges a one-time application fee, an annual fee, and a reservation charge. Gas, parking, insurance, and maintenance are included in the price.

Recent years have seen the creation of many Zipcar competitors. Traditional car rental companies have replicated Zipcar's short-term car rentals with programs including Hertz on Demand, Enterprise's WeCar, UHaul's Uhaul Car Share, and Daimler's Car2Go. Regional competitors exist, such as City CarShare in the San Francisco Bay Area, Mint in New York and Boston, I-GO in Chicago, among others. Peer-to-peer car sharing startups include RelayRides and Getaround.

In the autumn of 2007, Zipcar merged with Seattle-based rival Flexcar to create a nation-wide car sharing company. The company's IPO was in April 2011. Zipcar common stock traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol ""ZIP"" until 14 March 2013, when Avis Budget Group acquired Zipcar for US$500 million in cash.",http://www.zipcar.com/,"https://www.facebook.com/zipcar, https://twitter.com/zipcar",info@zipcar.com,http://www.zipcar.com/contact,Business,,for profit organization,2000-01-01 00:00:00,English,,,Collaborative consumption,Album,Service,No license,,International,karthik,461

Tizen,"Tizen (/ˈtaɪzɛn/) is a Linux-based operating system for devices—including smartphones, tablets, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) devices, smart TVs, Laptop's and smart cameras. Its licensing model involves software that uses a variety of open source licenses that may be incompatible (see Licensing model, below)—and a proprietary SDK. It aims to offer a consistent user experience across devices. Tizen is a project within the Linux Foundation and is governed by a Technical Steering Group (TSG) composed of Samsung and Intel among others.

The Tizen Association formed to guide the industry role of Tizen, including requirements gathering, identifying and facilitating service models, and overall industry marketing and education.[4] Members of the Tizen Association represent every major sector of the mobility industry and every region of the world. Current members include operators, OEMs and computing leaders: Fujitsu, Huawei, Intel Corporation, KT, NEC CASIO Mobile Communications, NTT DOCOMO, Orange, Panasonic Mobile Communications, Samsung, SK Telecom, Sprint and Vodafone.[5] While the Tizen Association decides what needs to be done in Tizen, the Technical Steering Group determines what code is actually incorporated into the operating system to accomplish those goals. Tizen roots back to the Samsung Linux Platform (SLP) and the LiMo Project and recently, Samsung merged its homegrown Bada project into Tizen.

The first week of October 2013, Samsung's NX300M smart camera became the first consumer product based on Tizen; it was sold in South Korea for a month before its OS was revealed at the Tizen Developer Summit, [6] [7] [8] then became available for pre-order in the US in early 2014 with a release date of March 1. The first Tizen tablet was announced by Systena in June 2013, a 10"" quad-core ARM with 1920x1200 resolution that was eventually shipped in late October 2013 as part of a development kit exclusive to Japan.[9][10][11] The Samsung Gear 2 smartwatch, announced a day before MWC 2014, is slated to be Tizen's first smartwatch, launching in April 2014.[12] The Samsung ZEQ 9000 will be the first commercially available smartphone running the operating system.[13]

CyanogenMod,"is an open source operating system for smartphones and tablet computers, based on the Android mobile platform. It is developed as free and open source software based on the official releases of Android by Google, with added original and third-party code. CyanogenMod releases are provided on a nightly, milestone, and ""stable version"" schedule.

CyanogenMod offers features and options not found in the official firmware distributed by mobile device vendors. Features supported by CyanogenMod include native theming support,[6] FLAC audio codec support, a large Access Point Name list, an OpenVPN client, revoking application permissions, support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB tethering, CPU overclocking and other performance enhancements, soft buttons and other ""tablet tweaks"", toggles in the notification pull-down (such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS), app permissions management, as well as other interface enhancements. According to its developers, CyanogenMod does not contain spyware or bloatware.[7][8] CyanogenMod is also stated to increase performance and reliability compared with official firmware releases.[9]

Although only a subset of total CyanogenMod users elect to report their use of the firmware,[10] as of February 2014, CyanogenMod has recorded over 11 million active installs on a multitude of devices.[11][12]

In 2013, project founder Steve Kondik announced that venture funding had been obtained to establish Cyanogen Inc. as a commercial enterprise to develop and market the firmware more widely. This announcement has led to controversy within the community, with some developers asserting that rights and licensing issues, acknowledging/compensating past developers and honoring the original ethos of the community project, are not being adequately addressed.",http://www.cyanogenmod.org/,"https://www.facebook.com/CyanogenMod, https://twitter.com/CyanogenMod, https://github.com/CyanogenMod, https://plus.google.com/+CyanogenMod/posts, https://www.youtube.com/user/CyanogenModTV",devrel@cyanogenmod.org,,,,not for profit organization,2010-01-01 00:00:00,English,,,FLOSS communities,Collage,Resource,Creative Commons: Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA),,International,karthik,457

Firefox OS is designed to provide a ""complete""[6] community-based alternative system for mobile devices, using open standards and approaches such as HTML5 applications, JavaScript, a robust privilege model, open web APIs to communicate directly with cellphone hardware,[4] and application marketplace. As such, it competes with proprietary systems such as Apple's iOS, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows Phone,[6] as well as other open source systems such as Jolla's Sailfish OS and Ubuntu Touch.

Firefox OS was publicly demonstrated in February 2012, on Android-compatible smartphones,[7][8] and again in 2013 running on Raspberry Pi.[9] In January 2013, at CES 2013, ZTE confirmed they would be shipping a smartphone with Firefox OS,[10] and on July 2, 2013, Telefónica launched the first commercial Firefox OS based phone, ZTE Open, in Spain[11][12] which was quickly followed by GeeksPhone's Peak+.[13]

They vary in age, profession and experience but they have a common goal: to make a real, measurable difference.

Asylos combines a commitment to donate time and expertise with a flexible work organization:  our researchers can choose when and where to spend time on Asylos. They work within teams of regional specialists supervised by a coordinator.  Currently, the coordinators are predominantly based in Paris, London and Brussels. They cover Asia, Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia and CIS and the Americas. In some cities we organise team meetings but our communication and coordination is predominantly online.

OpenROV,"OpenROV is a open-source underwater robot. Its operating system is based on Linux. It includes arduino code and node.js code running on the BeagleBone.
OpenROV is also a DIY community centered around underwater robots for exploration & adventure, formed by a group of amateur and professional ROV builders and operators from over 50 countries who have a passion for exploring the deep and are working together to create more accessible, affordable, and awesome tools for underwater exploration.
The backbone of the project is the global community of DIY ocean explorers who are working, tinkering and improving the OpenROV design. The community ranges from professional ocean engineers to hobbyists, software developers to students. It's a welcoming community and everyone's feedback and input is valued.
The idea to build OpenROV was pioneered by Eric Stackpole, a NASA spacecraft engineer at the time and David Lang, a self-taught sailor from Minnesota, who heard about Stackpole building a small, cheap, and robust submarine in his garage. The project started in a garage in Cupertino, with a few guys who wanted to explore an underwater cave, after finding a global community of co-developers on Kickstarter, has evolved into a network of connected devices, exploring the oceans and lakes of the world.

DiyDrones,"Community for amateur Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This community created the Arduino-based ArduPilot, the world's first universal autopilot (planes, multicopters of all sorts and ground rovers). The Pixhawk and APM 2.6 autopilots run a variety of powerful free and open UAV software systems, including: ArduCopter, a fully-autonomous multicopter and heli UAV system; ArduPlane, a pro-level UAV system for planes of all types; ArduRover, a fully-autonomous ground-based vehicle system.
ArduCopter is an open source multicopter aerial vehicle platform created by the DIY Drones community based on the Arduino platform and sold by 3D Robotics.
The free software approach from ArduCopter is similar to that of the Paparazzi Project and PX4 autopilot where low cost and availability enables its hobbyist use in small remotely piloted aircraft such as micro air vehicles and miniature UAVs.
The full-featured multicopter UAV controller won the Sparkfun 2013 Autonomous Vehicle Competition. A team of developers from around the globe are constantly improving and refining the performance and capabilities.
Programming and mission operations are done through an elegant and well-developed software interface. The entire package is designed to be easily approachable for the novice, while remaining open-ended for custom applications, education, and research use.

Freicoin,"Although mining is necessary for security, it consumes real world resources and it is not necessary to issue 100% of the total initial monetary base through mining in order to secure the network. The Freicoin Foundation will issue 80% of the initial monetary base to prevent this wasteful issuance (that maximizes the costs of production to minimize seigniorage) and to experiment with new issuance mechanisms.

The goal is to distribute the 80 million FRC before 2016. After this 3 year period the monetary base will remain stable at 100 million FRC and the 5% demurrage will be distributed p2p. This 3 year timeframe is a compromise between the foundation as a tool to bootstrap the currency and the need of an eventual removal of the issuance role of the foundation in order for the currency to become purely p2p. That means the annual 5% will go in full to miners if no alternative has been found.

The challenge is to design schemes in which the foundation doesn't have much control over the final issuance decisions while at the same time it can ensure transparency and that funds aren't issued against the foundation's principles.

If a fully p2p issuance mechanism alternative to mining is found, a mechanism (for example, proof-of-stake voting) could be established to determine how much goes to security (miners) and how much to the alternative.",http://freico.in/,"http://twitter.com/freicoin, http://identi.ca/freicoin, http://www.facebook.com/pages/Freicoin/227107500747148",,http://freicoin.freeforums.org/,Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network,,other,2014-01-01 00:00:00,English,,cryptocurrency money bitcoin,P2P currency,Exchange,"Resource, Others",Creative Commons: Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA),,International,JorgeLuisSalcedo,350

Slapos,"TioLive was created with the idea that a full ERP / CRM / email service could be offered based on a ""Freemium"" business model where occasional users get the service for free and power users pay a reasonable subscription fee. It was also created with the idea that a loyal service level agreement which protects privacy, trade secret and the ability to move away from SaaS to self-hosted open source solution would be a strong differentiator compared to leading proprietary SaaS.
Privacy protection, trade secret and freedom to leave are irrelevant differentiators for the vast majority of the market. The only aspect of TioLive which drew significant attention was its ""zero"" pricing, which is no longer a strong differentiator. Only very few TioLive users have considered to adopt its ""Premium"" offer, in a market where most competition is gratis.

Backdrop,"Backdrop CMS is a fork of Drupal 7, created with the purpose of offering a lower barrier entry.

Backdrop CMS started its existence as an offshoot or fork of Drupal. Although Backdrop originates from a common codebase with Drupal, its philosophy and organization are distinct. Backdrop practices a policy of focused releases, taking into account the feedback from the community. The overall direction is guided by the Backdrop Project Management Committee (PMC), modeled off of the Apache project. The direction of Backdrop is guided by the Backdrop Project Management Committee (PMC). The individuals that make up the committee are often but not necessarily committers to the project code repository. Their mission is to ensure that Backdrop follows the ideals of the project philosophy. If needed, it is also within their power to change the project philosophy, by a consensus agreement (a unanimous vote). The PMC handles any issue that has been escalated by one or more core committers or any issue at their discretion, at which time they will provide direction as needed.
Current PMC members are Nate Haug and Jen Lampton.
Additional individuals may be added to the committee by a unanimous vote by the PMC. Any current PMC member can nominate potential new members. Individuals may be removed from the committee by a simple majority vote. Decisions other than core philosophy changes and adding new core maintainers are taken by seeking consensus, with a majority vote as a fallback where needed. In the event of a tie within the PMC, an elected member of the PMC may break the tie. The tie-breaker may be elected at any time by a majority vote of the committee.",http://backdropcms.org/,"https://twitter.com/backdropcms, https://www.facebook.com/backdropcms, https://github.com/backdrop, https://plus.google.com/+BackdropcmsOrg/videos, https://www.youtube.com/user/backdropcms",backdrop@quicksketch.org,https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues,Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network,,other,2013-01-01 00:00:00,English,,"drupal,fork",FLOSS communities,Collage,Resource,GNU General Public License,Owner and infrastructure provider refers to the founding forker.,International,David Rozas,321

CiviCRM is used by many large NGOs including Amnesty International, Creative Commons, the Free Software Foundation, and the Wikimedia Foundation for their fundraising. There are also cases of very large record sets being used with one company claiming to have set up CiviCRM with a set of over 3 million constituents. CiviCRM is also used by Kabissa to provide CRM capabilities to over 1,500 organizations, mostly in Africa.
CiviCRM downloads are available from SourceForge, where it was 'project of the month' for January 2011.

Jenkins,"Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool written in Java. Jenkins CI, formerly known as ""Hudson Labs"", is a community-driven site for and by the Jenkins CI community. The project was forked from Hudson after a dispute with Oracle. Jenkins CI is the leading open-source continuous integration server. Built with Java, it provides 927 plugins to support building and testing virtually any project. 
Jenkins was originally developed as the Hudson project. Hudson's creation started in summer of 2004 at Sun Microsystems. Around 2007 Hudson became known as a better alternative to CruiseControl and other open-source build-servers. At the JavaOne conference in May 2008 the software won the Duke's Choice Award in the Developer Solutions category. 
During November 2010, an issue arose in the Hudson community with respect to the infrastructure used, which grew to encompass questions over the stewardship and control by Oracle. Negotiations between the principal project contributors and Oracle took place, and although there were many areas of agreement a key sticking point was the trademarked name ""Hudson"", after Oracle claimed the right to the name and applied for a trademark in December 2010. As a result, on January 11, 2011, a call for votes was made to change the project name from ""Hudson"" to ""Jenkins"". The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by community vote on January 29, 2011, creating the Jenkins project.
On February 1, 2011, Oracle said that they intended to continue development of Hudson, and considered Jenkins a fork rather than a rename. Jenkins and Hudson therefore continue as two independent projects, each claiming the other is the fork. As of December 2013, the Jenkins organisation on GitHub had 567 project members and around 1,100 public repositories, compared with Hudson's 32 project members and 17 public repositories.",http://jenkins-ci.org/,"https://twitter.com/jenkinsci, http://feeds.feedburner.com/ContinuousBlog, http://irc.freenode.net/join#jenkins, http://www.reddit.com/r/jenkinsci/, https://github.com/jenkinsci/",,http://jenkins-ci.org/content/mailing-lists,Grass Roots Organization Or Community Network,"Santa Clara, CAUnited States",other,2005-01-01 00:00:00,English,,,FLOSS communities,Collage,Resource,Creative Commons: Attribution (CC BY),,International,David Rozas,302

Debian,"The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is called Debian.

An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs. Debian GNU/Linux is one of the most popular Linux distributions for personal computers and network servers. 

Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel. Linux is a piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. FreeBSD is an operating system including a kernel and other software.

However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.

A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.

The Standby task force,"The Standby Task Force (SBTF) organizes digital volunteers into a flexible, trained and prepared network ready to deploy in crises.  The concept for the Task Force was launched at the 2010 International Conference on Crisis Mapping (ICCM 2010) to streamline online volunteer support for crisis mapping following lessons learned in Haiti, Chile and Pakistan, and to provide a dedicated interface for the humanitarian community. Our main objective is to effectively assist crisis affected communities through co-operation with local and international responders. To this effect, we aim to increase the ability and skills of SBTF volunteers through a continuous dialogue and coordination with other tech and crisis mapping volunteer efforts. This will enable SBTF to provide a sustainable and predictable service to first responders. We are also directly engaging colleagues from the traditional humanitarian community in order to develop the SBTF structure and protocols with full understanding of principles of effective and ethical humanitarian response.  Some members of the SBTF are professionals working in the fields of ICT and humanitarian response; many others come from diverse backgrounds and have been trained by the SBTF in the necessary skills to contribute.

(OSM) is a not-for-profit formed under United States and New York state law that provides organizational, legal, and financial support for the Joomla! open-source project.

Joomla was the result of a fork of Mambo on August 17, 2005. At that time, the Mambo name was trademarked by Miro International Pvt. Ltd., who formed a non-profit foundation with the stated purpose of funding the project and protecting it from lawsuits.[12] The Joomla development team claimed that many of the provisions of the foundation structure went against previous agreements made by the elected Mambo Steering Committee, lacked the necessary consultation with key stakeholders and included provisions that violated core open source values.[13]
Joomla developers created a website called OpenSourceMatters.org (OSM) to distribute information to users, developers, web designers and the community in general. Project leader Andrew Eddie wrote a letter[14] that appeared on the announcements section of the public forum at mamboserver.com. A little more than one thousand people had joined OpenSourceMatters.org within a day, most posting words of encouragement and support, and the website received the Slashdot effect as a result. Miro CEO Peter Lamont gave a public response to the development team in an article titled ""The Mambo Open Source Controversy — 20 Questions With Miro"".[15] This event created controversy within the free software community about the definition of ""open source"". Forums at many other open source projects were active with postings for and against the actions of both sides.
In the two weeks following Eddie's announcement, teams were re-organized, and the community continued to grow. Eben Moglen and the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) assisted the Joomla core team beginning in August 2005, as indicated by Moglen's blog entry from that date and a related OSM announcement.[16][17] The SFLC continue to provide legal guidance to the Joomla project.[18]
On August 18, Andrew Eddie called for community input on suggested names for the project. The core team indicated that it would make the final decision for the project name based on community input. The core team eventually chose a name that was not on the list of suggested names provided by the community. On September 22, the new name, ""Joomla!,"" was announced. It is the anglicised spelling of the Swahili word jumla meaning ""all together"" or ""as a whole""[19] which also has a similar meaning in at least Arabic and Urdu. On September 26, the development team called for logo submissions from the community and invited the community to vote on the logo; the team announced the community's decision on September 29. On October 2, brand guidelines, a brand manual, and a set of logo resources were published for the community's use.[20]

R ," R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.

Much of the work of science depends on having appropriate tools available to analyze experimental data and to interract with theoretical models. Powerful computers are now cheap enough so that significant processing power is within reach of many people. The missing piece of the puzzle is software that lets the scientist choose between models and make sense of his or her observations.
